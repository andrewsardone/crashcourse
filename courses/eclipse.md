# Eclipse Crash Course

## Introduction

A quick overview of some useful Eclipse features you won't know about unless someone tells you. You should explore Eclipse by right-clicking on things; that brings up several powerful options, like "Open Declaration" and "Refactor".

These tips have a Java-oriented bias (for now).

## Autocompletion

`ctrl + space`

This will pop up a menu with very intelligent and useful autocomplete suggestions. This feature alone cuts your typing by half.

## Fix Indentation

`cmd + i`

## Organize Imports

`cmd + shift + o`

This adds imports you're missing, removes ones you're not using, and formats/organizes them nicely.

## Move Back/Forward

`cmd + [` and `cmd + ]`

These move you back and forward when you're jumping around code with the "Open Declaration" and similar navigation tools.
